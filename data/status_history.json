(3) Adoption Check: News flow mentions AI-bubble fears and hedging via ETFs, but no explicit references to 'pilot purgatory', pausing, or canceling of AI projects by non-tech firms. Instead, we see examples of real adoption (e.g., an AI loan-processing startup scaling to $25M ARR, universities deepening AI partnerships). No adoption freeze, +0 risk. (4) Hardware Signals: No mentions of 'easing supply' or 'reduced lead times' for GPUs, so no evidence (from this dataset) of a demand cliff in AI hardware. +0 risk. All algorithmic triggers remain inactive, leading to a total Bubble Algorithm risk score of 0, which falls in the GREEN (Stable/Early Growth) band, despite increasingly nervous headlines.",
